### Support for 4.3.3

The originally developer of this plugin seems to have abandoned the project, I have made modifications to support 4.3.*. They may not be perfect, but they seem to work. 

* I am open to contributions and will review pull-requests

### Improved Rate Limiting

I have added support for better handling of Discords rate limits, this helps syncing with larger discords.

### Information

* This is a Discord Integration for IPS 4.3.x.
* Tested on >= 4.3.3, might work on older versions but those are not supported.
* If Installing using GitHub, create a directory called 'discord' in applications, then place these files into that new directory then install as normal. ie; {IPSPATH}/applications/discord/{these files}
